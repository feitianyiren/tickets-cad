1.	Tickets SP is an adjunct to standard Tickets CAD, a no-muss no-fuss implementation intended for use by 
	mobile responders utilizing small-screen devices such as smart-phones (hence 'SP') while on dispatch.  
	Required: an installed Tickets CAD application.  

2.	While it works on conventional desktop machines, users will see some waste of screen real-estate.  It's 
	been tested and shows satisfactory operation on the android-powered Nexus 4, iPhone and iPad, with Chrome 
	and Safari browsers.  Given the variety of mobile devices out there, Your Mileage Will Vary!  Let us know.

3.	What's it do?  Well, this version (9/6/2013) has capabilities targeted at mobile incident response, which 
	is well short of the gamut of a full-fledged Tickets operation.
	a.	SP uses and requires yr existing and correctly installed Tickets database.
	b.	SP attempts to locate you while mobile; doing so is controlled by your browser settings.
	c.  The map is by OpenStreetMap, with Google's an option;  While we also operate with OSM, the combined 
		downloads overwhelmed smaller devices during early testing.  We expect to get it working, however.
	d.  SP  provides useful information on existing calls, incidents, responders, facilities, and - new! - road 
	    information if yr database has any.  You can update status, add information to and close incidents, and 
	    send email.
	e.  On any detail page where an arrow icon shows, clicking on that row takes you to some useful page, 
		depending on the page context.
	f.	The smallish control in the map's upper right provides hide/show by layer in order to reduce map 
		clutter. Changes are immediate; no map reload is done.
	g.  Maps are full-screen; to navigate away, a right-click (desktop) or long-poke (mobile) on the map will 
	    bring up a navigation menu.
	h.  If you prefer to use Google maps, see file 'incs/sp.ini' , and 'un-comment' line 8.  That is, simply 
	    remove the leading semi-colon at the line that reads ";use_gmaps = On" and save the file.  (This is a 
	    common PHP usage for ini files.)

4.	Installing SP: Simply unzip it into its own directory underneath your Tickets root.  (There's no 
	installation process.)  You shd see the SP directory along with those 20-odd of Tickets proper.

5.	Accessing SP:  If your Tickets root is at, say, 'my_server/my_cad' then its URL is 'my_server/my_cad/sp' . 
	There, log-in using yr familiar Tickets login credentials.

6.	Navigate via the nav bar at each page bottom.  With lists displayed, click on the line/item of interest 
	to bring up its details.  There, wherever you see an arrow icon, clicking on that row will take you to a 
	page that provides some display or update functionality, depending on the context.	

7.	Futures:  TBD, and influenced by your responses.  (To an extent, this is an exercise to see what the minimal 
	amount of code can accomplish.)  But look for another mobile-oriented version by Andy Harvey, with a 
	somewhat different concept to its design and implementation.  It will include a tighter integration with 
	Tickets proper.  
	
Stay toon'd!
