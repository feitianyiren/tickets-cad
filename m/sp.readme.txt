1.	Tickets SP is an adjunct to standard Tickets CAD, a no-muss no-fuss implementation intended for use by 
	mobile responders utilizing small-screen devices such as smart-phones (hence 'SP') while on dispatch.  
	Required: an installed and functioning Tickets CAD.  

2.	While SP works on conventional desktop machines, users will see some waste of screen real-estate.  It's 
	been tested and shows satisfactory operation on the android-powered Nexus 4, iPhone and iPad, with Chrome 
	and Safari browsers.  Given the variety of mobile devices out there, Your Mileage Will Vary!  Let us know.

3.	What's it do?  Well, this version (12/26/2013) has capabilities targeted at mobile incident response, which 
	is short of the gamut of a full-fledged Tickets operation.
	a.	SP uses and requires yr existing and correctly installed Tickets database.
	b.  The 'together' feature is definitely experimental, and we'll appreciate any feedback on its operation.
		it's a user-to-user collaboration tool based on html5, so you'll need the latest/greatest in browser 
		versions.  It's by the Mozilla folks, and is claimed to support voice and screen-sharing.
	c.	It attempts to locate you while mobile; doing so is controlled by your browser settings.
	d.  The default map is Google's;  While we've been able to operate with that and OpenStreetMap concurrently, 
		the combined downloads overwhelmed smaller devices during early testing.
	e.  If you prefer to use OpenStreetMap over Google's, see file 'incs/sp.ini' and comment-out the line
		that reads 'use_gmaps = On'.  That is, simply insert a leading semi-colon and save the file.  (The 
		leading semi-colon is common PHP usage for ini files to denote comments.)
	f.  Maps are full-screen; to navigate away, the Menu button provides for that by bringing up a navigation menu.
	g.	The smallish control in the map's upper right provides hide/show by layer in order to reduce map 
		clutter. Changes are immediate; no map reload is done.
	h.	The mail operation now provides for including a map link to a selected incident.
	i.	Call/dispatch status may now be updated by users with suitable privileges.
	j.  SP  provides useful information on existing calls, incidents, responders, facilities, and - new! - road 
	    information if yr database has any.  You can update status, add information to and close incidents, and 
	    send email.

4.	Installing SP is trivial: Simply unzip it into its own directory underneath your Tickets root.  (There's no 
	installation process.)  You shd see the SP directory along with those 20-odd of Tickets proper.

5.	Accessing SP:  If your Tickets root is at, say, 'my_server/my_cad' then its URL is 'my_server/my_cad/sp' . 
	There, log-in using yr familiar Tickets login credentials.

6.	Navigate via the nav bar at each page bottom.  With lists displayed, click on the line/item of interest 
	to bring up its details.  There, wherever you see an arrow icon, clicking on that row will take you to a 
	page that provides some display or update functionality, depending on the context.	

7.	Futures:  TBD, and influenced by your responses.  (To an extent, this is an exercise to see what the minimal 
	amount of code can accomplish.)  But look for another mobile-oriented version by Andy Harvey, with a 
	somewhat different concept to its design and implementation.  It will include a tighter integration with 
	Tickets proper.  
	
Stay toon'd!
