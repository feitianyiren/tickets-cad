Under the heading of giving credit where it's due: The major source of the changes in this release as well as its immediate predecessor, is the good work of our Bashful Brit, Andy Harvey.

Download - along with its documentation - is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/openises/files/Tickets_2_13/  - we'll announce its availablity along with its documentationfrom www.ticketscad.org as soon as it's ready there.


Changes for Tickets V 2.13A

1.  Log information field sizes have been increased.  The Incident Management report now includes information log entries.  Reports now have a 'full width' option, in which longer data elements are not truncated.

2.  Unit and facility handles are used in the Situation Screen as the primary identification.  (Where the handle fields weren't used these were filled automatically from the unit name.   In addition, the short icon string is now a separately editable field, also filled  automatically for you.  (We strongly recommend you review your installation on both these points.)

3.  The dark/light color scheme may now be switched at any time while logged in, via button in the top frame.

4.  We applied a significant cleanup to the remote tracking modules; operation should be more reliable.

5.  On the situation screen, the call dispatch status now shows the time in minutes (maximum 99) since last update.

And, as always, we've applied a goodly number of corrections.
